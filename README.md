## Introduction
Cloning web applications is one of the way to improve one web deveploment skills. I have always think that the layout in Pinterest is cool. So, I decided to create a simple web application that shared the similar features, called INSPIRE-MEE.

## Purposes

* Learn how to use AJAX in Rails
* Implement masonry layout. (Like [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com))
* Learn implement sort feature. 

## Limitation

* No image moderation is carried out. User is able to share adult contents.

## Resources

* [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com)
	* Thanks to this [StackOverflow questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8470070/how-to-create-grid-tile-view-with-css), I discovered this library.
